  <p>Keeping a real live stream running is a huge pain. If you want to test something, demo some cool capability, or see how some interesting encoding feature works with a live stream, good luck. At minimum, you're re-reading that gripping live encoder documentation and fighting with your cloud provider of choice to spin up the flavor-of-the-month infrastructure.</p>
  <p>&hellip;or you could include <code>looper.mjs</code> in your page and let it turn any VOD HLS stream you can find into an infinitely repeating live stream, to enjoy to your heart's content. Your call.</p>
